# Stroke-detection

-> A project to detect stroke in individuals using machine learning.
-> EDA is performed and the dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. 
-> Imbalanced training dataset is handled using SMOTE , different classification models are fitted and hyperparametric tuning is used.
-> The best model is found to be Random forest classifier with parameters : criterion = 'entropy', n_estimators = 150, random_state = 0
   Accuracy : 93 %
